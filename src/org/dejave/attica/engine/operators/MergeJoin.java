/**
 * MergeJoin: Implements a merge join. The assumptions are that the
 * input is already sorted on the join attributes and the join being
 * evaluated is an equi-join.
 *
 * @author sviglas
 *
 * Krzysztow: 
 * The class implemenets a merge join algorithm, which execution takes place in few classes: OperatorSortMerger (inheriting from SortMerger2) with ExtensiblePagedList (wrapped in PagedListMergerBuffer) used as buffer.
 * How algorithm works is explained in {@link SortMerger2::doMerge()}. There were few options I chose from:
 * - without any additional buffer, but then Operator::tuples()::iterators() would have to be both-direction (next() & previous()). These seems like not the correct way, since would require architectural changes
 * 	and I have a feeling wouldn't work well with some of the operators;
 * - with additional buffer:
 *  The buffer is needed, since once we read tuple from Operator it cannot be re-read (which is necessary for joining with potential next tuple from second input). This had two options:
 * 	- buffering the group of equivalent tuples in a first group in list - not good, since we have no control over the memory consumption;
 * 	- buffering those tuples in a attica Page, which whenever filled is flushed to disk. This ensures we use no more than one in-memory page and in fact hurts performance only if:	
 * 		* the number of tuples in a group is larger than the one that fits into one page;
 * 		* we are so unfortunate that StorageManager evicted already a page - not so likely, since we are localized (in time) with page usage (and SM has LRU algorithm).
 * 
 * I removed inheritance from NestedLoopsJoins, since I see no reason to do it (there was also problem with outputFile being shadowed with MergeJoin.outputFile member) + uncommented MergeJoin::cleanup() method.
